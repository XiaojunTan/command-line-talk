# Command-Line Programs in Python

This is the repository for a talk I gave twice in 2014 and once in 2015, called **Command-Line Programs in Python**. There is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR73nLbbgqY#t=1) of this talk given at EuroPython 2014.

The main reason this is here is to give people access to the example code (in the examples dir) if they want it; and access to a PDF of the slides, which can be found in this directory.

If you're interested in a working if incomplete and slightly toy example of how I put together command-line tools, you could check out [envtool](https://github.com/judy2k/envtool)

I hope you find this useful - please feel free to submit suggestions via the GitHub bug tracker!
