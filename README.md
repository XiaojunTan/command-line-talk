# Command-Line Programs in Python

This is the repository for a talk I'm giving in 2014, called **Command-Line Programs in Python**. It's the slightly higher-level version of a talk I'm giving at Europython, called **Creating Awesome Command-Line Apps in Python**.

The main reason this is here is to give people access to the example code (in the examples dir) if they want it; and access to a PDF of the slides, which can be found in this directory.

I hope you find this useful - please feel free to submit suggestions via the GitHub bug tracker!
